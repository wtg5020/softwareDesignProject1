        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>There are many challenges faced by healthcare providers and the caregiving community in remotely monitoring and collecting critical health data of their loved ones/patients at a centralized location. It is specifically true in the era of COVID-19 that healthcare providers and caregivers have more responsibility to monitor their loved ones/patients' health due to the social distancing guidelines.</p>
        <p>The Enhanced Digital Nurse Assistant (EDNA) Care System application aims to solve these challenges by offering caregivers and healthcare providers an effective way to monitor their loved ones'/patients' health and metrics remotely and modernize how to maintain their health data and reports in real-time. This data can be accessed by healthcare providers and caregivers to provide valuable guidance to the care receivers. The system encompasses several algorithms to aid in early detection, and the event-driven architecture will send notifications and alerts to those who need to know, getting people the care they need quicker and more efficiently. Having a highly secured system will ensure patients that their data is safe and used to monitor and improve their health effectively. A well-architected solution can mean the difference between life and death for the end-user; we stand by our design due to its reliability, scalability, and performance.</p>
