          <h3>Scenario 1.</h3>
            <p>James is the primary caregiver and sole decision-maker for his 80-year-old mother, Mrs. Alfred, who was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Mrs. Alfred lives at home with her 81-year-old husband, Mr. Alfred, who has a series of health issues of his own, which enables him to be his wife's primary caregiver. On some occasions, she struggles with remembering where she is, figuring out what she is supposed to do for the day, feeling confused and disoriented, trouble perceiving time and dates, and having difficulty communicating with others. Unfortunately, James' full-time position does not allow him to manage his mother's care, so he has to rely on sending her text reminders of what she is supposed to be doing for the day, especially reminding her about her medication. James also calls and speaks to his father to ensure that she is on the right track.</p>
            <p>Despite her Alzheimer's disease, Mrs. Alfred loved to take her afternoon walks around he neighborhood by herself and returned home on her own within 1 hour. One afternoon, Mr. Alfred had noticed that his wife had not returned from her regular afternoon stroll. Due to his health condition, Mr. Alfred could not walk around the neighborhood to search for his wife. Mr. Alfred reached out to his son, James, to inform him that Mrs. Alfred had not returned home. Concerned, James immediately left his job and began heading towards his parents' neighborhood to search for his mother. James had searched for about a 1 hour around the neighborhood, asking neighbors if they had seen his mother walking around.</p>
            <!--TODO: Fix figures-->
            <p>Given that it was soon to become dark out, James returned to his parents' home to call the police to report her missing. As he began to walk towards his parents' door, a neighbor came up behind him with his mother. The neighbor told James that she had found Mrs. Alfred at a nearby park sitting on a park bench. James was pleased and relieved that his mother was returned safely home by a neighbor. James would love to have a much better way of tracking his mother quicker if she should go missing again. With EDNA care, James would have been able to locate his mother more accurately and efficiently by utilizing the app's GPS portion if she had worn a wearable device linked to the application.

        <h3>Scenario 2.</h3>
            <p>Jennifer is a thirty-five-year-old mother to Emily, who is 12. Emily is a sweet girl who enjoys reading, dancing, hanging out with friends and family, and drawing. Emily’s epilepsy journey started when she was just three years old. At the age of 8, Emily started having frequent seizures, and Jennifer had to increase her medication dosage. However, the medication came with multiple side effects; Emily would fall asleep in class, take naps at school, felt depressed and fatigued. In addition to that, Emily was also full of anxiety, she was not growing, and she would shy away from her family. Jennifer recognized that the medication was not helping, so she decided to place Emily on a diet to help with her seizures. To her surprise, the diet worked, and Emily was growing and back to her joyful self. After a few years, Jennifer weaned Emily off the diet, and she remained relatively seizure-free.</p>
            <p>One late night, Jennifer was awakened by a noise that she could not make out. She walked out of her bedroom and saw that the hallway bathroom light was on, and the door was closed. She waited a few seconds, and she heard the noise again coming from the bathroom. Jennifer immediately ran to the bathroom to find her daughter, Emily, faced down, seizing. It was a terrifying experience for Jennifer to find her daughter blue, unresponsive and seizing. Jennifer quickly picked her up, placed her on her side, and contacted 911. While at the hospital, Jennifer found out that her daughter’s seizure had lasted over ten minutes. After a few hours, Emily was discharged with emergency medication. As a result, Jennifer decided to have Emily sleep in her bedroom in fear of her daughter having another late-night seizure. She wishes she had a device  of some sort that would alert her whenever her daughter’s seizures would start and track how long each lasted. With EDNA Care, Jennifer would be alerted immediately should Emily experience another seizure. EDNA Care will also alert Emily’s health care physician if her seizures last longer than expected.</p>
